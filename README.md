On the first dashboard is a breakdown by gender stats. Starting in the top left we have a heatmap that displays a breakdown of what gender bikes at what day and hour of the week. The charts immediately below show the breakdown of users by gender overall and the frequency of trips per day of the week per gender divided into subscribers of the service and customers. The right side of the dashboard shows the length of the trip from 0-3 hours for each gender.

On the second dashboard we have a breakdown of the top starting locations as defined by popularity (size and color) of each spot. On the right bottom we have a trip duration graph which shows the distribution of bikes vs the time taken for each trip. And finally on the top right is show a break down of the peak usage hours during the month of August.

## Summary

Overall usage is higher during the end of the week for subscribers  with a peak of users riding during the hours immediately before the workday and after the workday (6-8 AM and 5-7 PM). The percentage of riders that are male make up almost double the percentage of riders that are female for all user types. The peak ride time for all users is around 5 minutes with the majority of rides falling under the 45 minute duration marker.
